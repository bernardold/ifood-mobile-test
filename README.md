# ifood-mobile-test
Create an app that given an Twitter username it will list user's tweets. When I tap one of the tweets the app will visualy indicate if it's a happy, neutral or sad tweet.

## Business rules
* Happy Tweet: We want a vibrant yellow color on screen with a üòÉ emoji
* Neutral Tweet: We want a grey colour on screen with a üòê emoji
* Sad Tweet: We want a blue color on screen with a üòî emoji
* For the first release we will only support english language

### Hints
* You may use Twitter's oficial API (https://developer.twitter.com) to fetch user's tweets 
* Google's Natural Language API (https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/) may help you with sentimental analysis.

## Non functional requirements
* As this app will be a worldwide success, it must be prepared to be fault tolerant, responsive and resilient.
* Use whatever language, tools and frameworks you feel comfortable to.
* Briefly elaborate on your solution, architecture details, choice of patterns and frameworks.
* Fork this repository and submit your code.
